Objectives: build intcode program

OPCODES:
1: adds together two numbers and stores the result
2: multiplies together two numbers and stores the result
99: program is finished
-After an opcode has been processed, move forward four positions to find the
next one

OPCODE PARAMETERS:
-The two numbers directly following an opcode indicate the positions of the
numbers to be added or multiplied
-The third number after an opcode indicates where the sum or product should be
stored
